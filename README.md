**Horse Racing Game**

**Overview:**
The Horse Racing Game is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a horse race. Players can design their own race track, select the number of lanes, specify the race distance, and enter the names of the horses. During the race, players can observe the progress of each horse and view the final results. The application provides statistics on horse wins and allows players to place bets on their chosen horses.

**Features:**
1. **Custom Race Track Design:** Players can customize the race track by selecting the number of lanes and specifying the race distance.
2. **Horse Selection:** Players can enter the names of the horses participating in the race and select symbols to represent them.
3. **Real-time Race Simulation:** The application simulates the race in real-time, allowing players to observe the progress of each horse.
4. **Race Results:** After the race, players are presented with the final results, including the winning horse and any bets placed.
5. **Statistics:** Players can view statistics on horse wins to track the performance of each horse.
6. **Betting System:** Players have the option to place bets on their chosen horses, with winnings calculated based on the outcome of the race.

**How to Play:**
1. Launch the application.
2. Design the race track by selecting the number of lanes and specifying the race distance.
3. Enter the names of the horses participating in the race and select symbols to represent them.
4. Click "Start Race" to begin the race simulation.
5. Observe the progress of each horse in real-time.
6. After the race, view the final results and statistics.
7. Optionally, place bets on horses for the next race and repeat the process.

**Dependencies:**
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Swing library

**Files:**
