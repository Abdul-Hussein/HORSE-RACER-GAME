# Horse Racing Simulator

## Overview
The Horse Racing Simulator is a Java application that simulates a horse race with three horses running in their respective lanes for a given distance. Each horse's movement depends on its confidence rating, and the race ends when one of the horses reaches the finish line or falls. Winners gain confidence, encouraging them to perform better in subsequent races.

## Features
